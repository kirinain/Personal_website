My name is Kiriti Nain, I'm a tech innovator specializing in robotics, and AI, with expertise in machine learning platforms and ROS technologies. As a robotics enthusiast and A.T.O.M Robotics Lab member, I create innovative solutions bridging software, hardware, and educational technologies. My passion lies in sustainable development.

In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also a keen reader and my favourite author is John Green.
